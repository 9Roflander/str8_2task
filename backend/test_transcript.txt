Okay, are we—is everyone here? Where's... wait, where's Jen?

She's pinged me, she's dropping off kids. She'll be late.

Okay, whatever. Let's go. Mark, you're up.

Yeah, so... uh... yesterday was a mess. I tried to run the migration we talked about, the user table one? It completely blew up staging. Like, 500 errors everywhere. So I spent the whole afternoon just rolling that back.

Wait, is that why the QA environment was down? I couldn't test the payment gateway.

Yeah, sorry. It's back now. Anyway, I'm not... I don't think I can fix it today. I need to talk to Ops about the permissions.

Okay, hold on. Do we need a ticket for the Ops request?

No, I just need to slack Bob. But actually... Sarah, can you maybe look at the logs? If you have time?

I'm pretty swamped with the payment API. That's actually my update. I'm stuck on the Stripe webhook. It's not returning the right—uh—token? I think the documentation is outdated.

Is that a blocker?

Definitely. I can't finish the checkout flow without it.

Alright. Mark, forget the migration for a sec. Can you pair with Sarah on the Stripe thing? That's higher priority.

Ugh, okay. I'll park my ticket. What number was that?

PROJ-404.

Cool. So Mark is helping Sarah on 404. Anything else?

Oh, one more thing. The coffee machine is broken.

Not a Jira ticket, Mark. Okay, let's move on. Sam? QA update?

Yeah, can you hear me? My mic was acting up. Okay. So, because Staging was down, I couldn't verify the Header Fix ticket. That was... DEV-399, I think. I'm gonna move that back to "In Progress" because I technically haven't passed it yet.

Make sense. Anything else?

Yeah, I found a new issue on the mobile view. The "Search" bar disappears when you rotate the screen on iOS. It's pretty bad. I haven't logged it yet.

Okay, log that immediately after this call. Is that a release blocker for Friday?

I'd say yes. If we ship with a broken search, support is gonna kill us.

Wait, I thought we removed the search bar on mobile for this release? I updated the Figma last week.

Nobody told me. The ticket says "Responsive Search."

Okay, sidebar. Alex, check the requirements on DEV-300. If we cut it, close the ticket. If not, Sam logs the bug. Let's resolve that offline. Jen? I see you joined.

Hey, sorry! School drop-off was a nightmare. I'm here. Uh, update... yesterday I finished the User Profile UI components. I put the PR up this morning.

Nice. Who's reviewing?

I tagged Mark, but I know he's busy with the migration thing.

I'm actually pairing with Sarah now, so I probably can't look at it until tomorrow.

Okay... um... Alex? Can you verify the CSS at least? I don't want to merge if the margins are off again like last time.

Yeah, send me the staging link. I'll look at it before lunch.

So Jen, what are you picking up today?

I was gonna start the Settings Page, but I don't have the assets for the dark mode icons. Alex, are those ready?

Ah, shoot. No. I was focusing on the marketing landing page yesterday. I can get you the icons by... maybe 3 PM?

Okay. I'll do some refactoring on the utils folder until then. No blockers other than the assets.
