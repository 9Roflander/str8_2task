Current transcript:
One quick thing. Are we still doing the retro on Thursday? Or moving it because of the demo?

IMPORTANT: You MUST generate at least 1 clarifying question. Even if everything seems clear, find something to ask about.

Analyze the meeting content and generate 2-5 concise clarifying questions that should be asked to the meeting participants.

Focus on identifying:
1. **Missing Assignees**: Action items or tasks mentioned without a clear owner
2. **Unclear Deadlines**: Tasks without specific due dates or vague timelines ("soon", "later")
3. **Ambiguous Requirements**: Items that need more specific definition or acceptance criteria
4. **Missing Priorities**: Tasks that lack urgency/importance classification
5. **Unclear Dependencies**: References to blockers or prerequisites that aren't well defined
6. **Next Steps**: What should happen next?
7. **Decisions**: What decisions need to be made?

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- ALWAYS generate at least 1 question, even if you have to be creative
- Questions should be SHORT and DIRECT (1-2 sentences max)
- Questions should be suitable for posting in a meeting chat
- Questions should be actionable - asking for specific information
- Use names if mentioned in the transcript
- Format questions conversationally, as if you're asking in the meeting
- End each question with a question mark "?"

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
- "Who will be handling the Stripe webhook fix?"
- "What's the deadline for the API documentation?"
- "Can we confirm the priority for the VPN issue - is it blocking the release?"
- "Is the database migration dependent on the auth service being ready?"
- "What are the next steps for this project?"

Return ONLY a JSON array of question strings. Example:
["Who should be assigned to this task?", "What is the deadline for this?"]

CRITICAL: Always return at least 1 question. Never return an empty array.

You are a meeting facilitator analyzing a transcript to identify items that need clarification from meeting participants.

Recent context:
Oh god, yes. I got locked out of stuff this morning.
Current transcript:
Um and uh but to avoid adding three net new meetings to stakeholders counters and propose we do a sort of two month rotation. So month one, development quality go, month two security and UX would go.

IMPORTANT: You MUST generate at least 1 clarifying question. Even if everything seems clear, find something to ask about.

Analyze the meeting content and generate 2-5 concise clarifying questions that should be asked to the meeting participants.

Focus on identifying:
1. **Missing Assignees**: Action items or tasks mentioned without a clear owner
2. **Unclear Deadlines**: Tasks without specific due dates or vague timelines ("soon", "later")
3. **Ambiguous Requirements**: Items that need more specific definition or acceptance criteria
4. **Missing Priorities**: Tasks that lack urgency/importance classification
5. **Unclear Dependencies**: References to blockers or prerequisites that aren't well defined
6. **Next Steps**: What should happen next?
7. **Decisions**: What decisions need to be made?

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- ALWAYS generate at least 1 question, even if you have to be creative
- Questions should be SHORT and DIRECT (1-2 sentences max)
- Questions should be suitable for posting in a meeting chat
- Questions should be actionable - asking for specific information
- Use names if mentioned in the transcript
- Format questions conversationally, as if you're asking in the meeting
- End each question with a question mark "?"

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
- "Who will be handling the Stripe webhook fix?"
- "What's the deadline for the API documentation?"
- "Can we confirm the priority for the VPN issue - is it blocking the release?"
- "Is the database migration dependent on the auth service being ready?"
- "What are the next steps for this project?"

Return ONLY a JSON array of question strings. Example:
["Who should be assigned to this task?", "What is the deadline for this?"]

CRITICAL: Always return at least 1 question. Never return an empty array.

Yeah. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't verify the fixed. But I still can't move the moment. I need ops to sort out permissions.
I'm swamped. The Stripe webhook is failing. It's not returning the right token. And I think the docs are outdated.
Current transcript:
All right then. Pause the migration. Pair up on Stripe instead. Higher priority.

IMPORTANT: You MUST generate at least 1 clarifying question. Even if everything seems clear, find something to ask about.

Analyze the meeting content and generate 2-5 concise clarifying questions that should be asked to the meeting participants.

Focus on identifying:
1. **Missing Assignees**: Action items or tasks mentioned without a clear owner
2. **Unclear Deadlines**: Tasks without specific due dates or vague timelines ("soon", "later")
3. **Ambiguous Requirements**: Items that need more specific definition or acceptance criteria
4. **Missing Priorities**: Tasks that lack urgency/importance classification
5. **Unclear Dependencies**: References to blockers or prerequisites that aren't well defined
6. **Next Steps**: What should happen next?
7. **Decisions**: What decisions need to be made?

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- ALWAYS generate at least 1 question, even if you have to be creative
- Questions should be SHORT and DIRECT (1-2 sentences max)
- Questions should be suitable for posting in a meeting chat
- Questions should be actionable - asking for specific information
- Use names if mentioned in the transcript
- Format questions conversationally, as if you're asking in the meeting
- End each question with a question mark "?"

EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
- "Who will be handling the Stripe webhook fix?"
- "What's the deadline for the API documentation?"
- "Can we confirm the priority for the VPN issue - is it blocking the release?"
- "Is the database migration dependent on the auth service being ready?"
- "What are the next steps for this project?"

Return ONLY a JSON array of question strings. Example:
["Who should be assigned to this task?", "What is the deadline for this?"]

CRITICAL: Always return at least 1 question. Never return an empty array.
